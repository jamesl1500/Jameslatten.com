            <h3>Theres not much to say about me, I'm just some guy that likes to create things. I've always had a passion for programming, and now I have an even bigger passion for patient care. I was born <b>February 13th, 1999</b>. Since then I've been riding this rollarcoaster of a life all the way to where I am now.</h3><br>
            <h3 class="">I'm one of Jehovahs Witnesses and I spend a lot of my time going door to door talking to neighbours about god and his son. Oh, I love to read books, I love listening to indie music and I love to just explore different areas and different things. Manga and Poetry are my favorite book genres by the way! I love photography as well and taking beautiful looking pictures.</h3><br>
            <h3>I also run a small web development studio called <a href="https://sitelyftstudios.com" "="">Sitelyft Studios, LLC</a>. I also go by <a href="blog.jameslatten.com">Jaye Aesthetic</a>. Well yeah, thats just a few things. Scroll down more and get to know me a little bit better...</h3>
